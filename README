We are studying the runtime control and adjustement of the core frequencies in
many-core processors to optimize parallel programs.  Specifically we are
interested in developing techniques to increase the frequencies on cores that
are on the critical path and decrease the frequencies of cores that are off the
critical path.  This archive contains the software codes that we are using to
explore our hypotheses in this area.  We welcome suggestions and comments at
wilseypa@gmail.com.  Thank you.
